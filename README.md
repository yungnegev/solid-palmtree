This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description 

This is a fully fledged ecommerce application, using Next.js, sass, sanity and stripe for payment processing. The app is fully functional, with a comprehensive layout, shopping cart, payment section and a post payment page.

## Key lessons

- state management with react context and hooks
- implementing more complex api's 
- next.js and the routing approach that comes with next
- using small npm packages such as react-toast to handle small actions such as notifications
